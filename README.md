# Open Source Checklist

## Aim and objective

Context: projects with a digital component, in the broad field of international development cooperation
Objective of this checklist: provide a list of points / questions / topics that need to be discussed / brainstormed / resolved / challenged when deciding to go for Open Source

## Disclaimer

The collective behind this checklist has a positive bias towards Open Source, and is moved by the conviction that, in most cases, Open Source is the best approach for development cooperation projects (lack of resources from the partners to pay for licenses on the long-term; co-financing of projects through several donors; mutualization and cross-fertilization; make a more transparent use of public money; involvement of local IT companies for the development and maintenance; etc.). However, we are also pragmatic and fully acknowledge that, in some situations, proprietary solutions are the way to go (typically: when a partner already uses a proprietary software, it often makes more sense to further build their capacities on this software than to re-invent the wheel and force new tools, processes and approaches on them).

## Introduction
* An open source tool is generally associated to a software whose code is freely available. 
* There are different types of open source licences. The most common ones are to be found on https://opensource.org/licenses/
* We need to distinguish between open source libraries and open source tools.
* We need to distinguish between "using existing OpenSource software" (typically in our context: QGIS, NextCloud, etc.) vs. "developping OpenSource tools" (incl. code and community management, choice of license, long-term ownership, etc.)
* Digital Public Goods: define whether this is relevant (as a quality label?)
* Public money - public code - no blackbox


## Open Source checklist by project stage
<em>As you will see below, we are back to the question on general digital projects versus specifically open source. Maybe we could have a very brief general point and below each of them something like: specific to consider for open source choices....? Or kick out all the general stuff</em>


### Prefeasibility and feasibility stage
The (pre)feasibility stage can set the stage for a possible preference on open source. This choice should be based on:
- a precise problem definition
- a definition of the use case(s) including users, contributers (e.g. data providers), decisiontakers (those who decide whether the tool is being used and at which scale)
- existing software in use
- digital capacities at hosting institution (partner or project team):
  - digital skills in team: if low, then propose STE that understands the technical language to accompany tendering and initial stages of implementation > prepare the team for having to be deeply involved in the design and implementation (giving frequent feedback, testing, reviewing)
  - dedicated IT department responsible for hosting and maintenance
- availability of existing open source tools that match the problem definition with their level of maturity
  - how to assess the maturity of a digital tool?
      - timeline of existence
      - size and activity level of community > vendor lock-in
      - existing number of service providers offering hosting, setup, adaptations...
- contribution to an open source community or trying to build up a new one?
- better small and feasible, than too large and complex
- review overall cost for different options (open source and non-open source)
- consider vendor lockin
- interperability above open source?
  
### What to consider when writing ToR
- develop a product vision
- make clear which aspects about the software, its implementation or use are still unclear > derive from that: requirement to use a specific open source tool or to find an appropriate solution
- methods: the more unknown the more agile is needed
- Assess the running costs of the software - hosting, maintenance, support, further development - for different options
- Consider whether only user training is needed, or also training for contributers, IT departments, etc.
- 
### What to consider in the discovery phase
- identify detailed user needs
- translate them into technical requirements
- develop a clear product vision
- re-assess the running costs of the software - hosting, maintenance, support, further development - for different options

### What to consider for the implementation phase
- Schnittstellen
- the clearer the more to think about priorization of features (narrow vs broad use cases)
- timeline for user uptake
- handover 

### What to consider for the maintenance and support phase
- clarify costs/staff responsibilities for hosting and maintenance, if there is no one then get a contract with a provider for that
- clarify....
