# Start

Welcome to the *Open Source guideline for Development Cooperation projects*. This guideline is designed to help people working in development cooperation to:

  - Take a well-informed decision for or against the use, introduction or development of open source tools 
  - Avoid late failure and unexpected cost through appropiate planning

It is written from the perspective of practitioners working in publicly funded development cooperation projects and organizations. We wish for that it might make a contribution towards more successful open source endeavors and more sustainable digital solutions in general.

## How to read this guideline

The guideline is structured in a way that it can be read from start to finish, but also be used as a reference guide. It is divided into three main parts:
