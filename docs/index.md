# Start

Welcome to the *Open Source guideline for Development Cooperation projects*. This guideline is designed to help people working in development cooperation to:

  - Take a well-informed decision for or against the use, introduction or development of open source tools 
  - Avoid late failure and unexpected cost through appropiate planning

It is written from the perspective of practitioners working in publicly funded development cooperation projects and organizations. We wish for that it might make a contribution towards more successful open source endeavors and more sustainable digital solutions in general.

## How to read this guideline

The guideline is structured in a way that it can be read from start to finish, but also be used as a reference guide. It is divided into three main parts:

  1. **Introduction**: This part provides an overview of the guideline and essential terminology. It also introduces the three cases of open source software use in development cooperation projects. 
  1. **Preproject IT selection**: This part provides a checklist for the preproject phase, where the project team is still in the process of defining the project and its requirements. 
  1. **Writing ToRs**: This part provides a checklist for the writing of Terms of Reference (ToRs) for the procurement of open source software.
